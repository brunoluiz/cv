          <p>
            <em>Utility Warehouse (UW)</em> is a multi-utility company focused
            on bringing all of them to a single bill. Within the customer
            sign-up team, worked on a new leads pipeline and new sign-up process
            (Golang & NodeJS), making it easier and faster for our sales
            partners to sign up new customers. Helped with planning and
            implementing cross-cloud high availability strategy (AWS, GCP and a
            local cluster).

          </h4>
          <p>
            Within the partner team, developed tools to help our sales partners.
            These included an event booking centre, team insight tools and a
            gamification system. Within the customer domain, helped to bootstrap
            remote sales website (helping partners with sales during lockdown).
            Also worked on customer incentives and marketing lead pipelines.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of these projects required high availability and scale. To
            achieve this, modern technologies were used (Golang, Kubernetes,
            CockroachDB, Typescript, gRPC), all integrated with an
            event-driven architecture (Kafka). Part of the deliverables was
            critical to decommission legacy processes.

          </h4>
          <p>
            <em>Linx+Neemu+Chaordic</em> is a major retail and e-commerce
            solutions provider in Brazil. Worked mainly on the inception
            of the Omni-channel platform, focusing on the freight
            calculation platform and inventory control across multiple
            stores. This platform enhanced the ability of clients
            to sell cross-channel (online and physical stores), requiring
            these services to have high availability and elasticity
            (especially during sales seasons). To reach these goals,
            technologies such as NodeJS, Golang, ElasticSearch were used,
            hosted on AWS.

          <p>
            <em>CERTI</em> is a pioneering research foundation involved in many
            national R&D key projects. Developed and maintained test systems for
            Digital TV GINGA-BR decoders (C++ and Lua) during the internship.
            After that, implemented many communication protocols (MODBUS, CAN,
            OCPP) into Electric Vehicle Charging Station and Microgrids
            controllers, both focused on studying green energy solutions
            viability for the region (C++ and Java).

                <em>INEP</em> is a power electronics institute located at UFSC
                campus. Implemented a basic human-machine
                interface for a solar boat project (mainly telemetry), ending up
                with a basic UI implementation in QT (C++). Within the
                communications field, implemented the MODBUS stack
                (slave/master) for Texas Instruments DSPs (C), used in many
                other projects within the institute.

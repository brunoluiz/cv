            Senior Software Engineer, Utility Warehouse, London - United
            Kingdom <span>[01/2021 - 2021]</span>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <em>Utility Warehouse (UW)</em> is a multi-utilities company focused
            on bringing all under one bill. Within the customer sign-up
            team, I was involved in enhancing our sales channels, by helping
            in building a new leads pipeline and new sign-up processes
            (Golang & NodeJS), making it easier and faster for our partners
            to close sales. To reach better SLO (Service Level Objective)
            within these services, I helped in planning and implementing our
            cross-cloud high availability strategy (AWS, GCP and a local
            cluster).

            Software Engineer, Utility Warehouse, London - United Kingdom
            <span>[09/2018 - 12/2020]</span>
          </h4>
          <p>
            Within the partner team, we developed tools to help business
            partners to thrive in their business, such as an event booking
            centre, team insight tools and gamification systems; Within the
            customer domain, I helped to bootstrap our remote sales website
            (helping partners with sales during Corona), customer incentives
            and marketing lead pipelines.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of these projects required high availability and scale. To
            achieve this, modern technologies were used (Golang, Kubernetes,
            CockroachDB, Typescript, gRPC), all integrated with an
            event-driven architecture (Kafka). Some of the deliverables were
            critical to decommission some legacy processes.

            Software Engineer, Linx+Neemu+Chaordic, Florianópolis - Brazil
            <span>[03/2017 - 08/2018]</span>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <em>Linx+Neemu+Chaordic</em> is a major retail and e-commerce
            solutions provider in Brazil. I worked mainly on the inception
            of the Omni-channel platform, focusing on the freight
            calculation platform and inventory control across multiple
            stores. This platform enhanced the ability of clients
            to sell cross-channel (online and physical stores), requiring
            these services to have high availability and elasticity
            (especially during sales seasons). To reach these goals,
            technologies such as NodeJS, Golang, ElasticSearch were used,
            hosted on AWS.

            Embedded System Developer, CES - CERTI Foundation, Florianópolis -
            Brazil <span>[2013 - 2015; 2016 - 03/2017]</span>
          </h4>
          <p>
            <em>CERTI</em> is a pioneering research foundation involved in
            many national R&D key projects. During my internship in CERTI, I
            helped with the development and maintenance of test systems for
            Digital TV GINGA-BR decoders (C++ and Lua). During the rest of
            my tenure, we implemented different communication protocols (MODBUS,
            CAN, OCPP) into Electric Vehicle Charging Station and Microgrids
            controllers, both focused on studying green energy solutions
            viability for the region and country (C++ and Java).

              Student Researcher, INEP - Power Electronics Institute,

                <em>INEP</em> is a power electronics institute located at UFSC
                campus. I've helped with implementing a basic human-machine
                interface for a solar boat project (mainly telemetry), ending up
                with a basic UI implementation in QT (C++). Within the
                communications field, I've implemented the MODBUS stack
                (slave/master) for Texas Instruments DSPs (C), used in many
                other projects within the institute.
